# Welcome to the non-official 2D Soccer Simulation tutorial for RoboCup

**NOTE**:
- In all articles, the character $ represents a terminal. Thus, whenever this symbol is shown, it means that what comes next should be typed in a terminal. 

- It is preferable to use your Linux distribution in English. Some problems were reported when executing the simulator when the system language uses comma as decimal separator, for example, Portuguese language.
